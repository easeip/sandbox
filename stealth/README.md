Another Stealth Address Idea
============================

This is very early thinking and such...

```
# 1. Clone the repo
> git clone git@github.com:ricmoo/sandbox.git

# 2. I want to go to there
> cd sandbox/stealth

# 3. Install all the dependencies   
> npm install

# 4. Run stuff?
> node index.js
```
